## Overview

This repo is deisgned to teach you how to use Regular Expressions like a pro! Regular expressions or 'regexes' are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are extremely handy but can quickly become quite complicated. Follow the instructions below to get started on your regex journey...✈️

## Part 1

1. To start off, watch this video: [Learn Regular Expressions In 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk)
2. Try your hand at these lessons on [regexone.com](https://regexone.com/). If you are having difficulty, the solutions are available on each page.
3. Follow along with this [codebubb video](https://dev.to/codebubb/javascript-regex-exercises-01-5078) and write your answers in the `regex.js` file in this repo. Test your answers by running `node regex.js` in the terminal.
4. `Add`, `commit` and `push` your code to your branch.

## Part 2

Now it is time for you to apply your regex skills to your personal project!

- Create an input field where a user can enter some text.
- When the user submits their text, I want to see that text displayed below the input field.
- Using regexes, I want that text to display ONLY if it is a valid gmail address with the format "example@gmail.com".
- Now I want to see 2 more input fields, one for name and one for age.
- Using regexes, I want only valid names and ages to be displayed below.
- Now think of another way you can incorporate regexes into your project. 

Nice work! 🎉
